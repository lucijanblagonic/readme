# Lucijan.readme

## Quick start guide

* I currently live in [Dublin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin) with my partner Ana and our child Remi. We moved from [Zagreb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zagreb) (before that from [Istra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istria)) to Dublin. That was a big but welcome change of scenery for us and definitely a new chapter in our life.

* I consider myself a creative person, been designing things in one form or the other all my life. Digital design stuck with me the most and this is how I like to spend my days — solving problems through the lens of design, especially around [design systems](https://garden.zendesk.com/). 

* I am an open-source enthusiast. That's why I will happily [contribute](http://polarnorth.org/blog/design-adventures-in-open-source/) my time and skill to [open-source software](https://wordpress.org/) and communities, either by volunteering, [organising](http://polarnorth.org/blog/wordcamp-europe-2018/) or [giving talks](http://polarnorth.org/blog/moving-the-design-process-to-the-browser/) and workshops.

* My hobbies include photography, hiking, gaming, woodworking and astronomy. I built many great long-lasting friendships through astronomy (met my partner Ana as well) and it changed my perspective on how I think about the world, the universe and our impact here. My taste in music is, well, weird. I am a big ABBA fanboy, can almost recite Hamilton soundtrack from memory and will happily _rock_ with a loud System of a Down or Green Day listening session.

For a truly in-depth look about who I am and how I think, I suggest you continue with this [interview](https://www.anarieldesign.com/wordpress-interview-lucijan-blagonic/) and go over several entries in [my blog](http://polarnorth.org/blog) (which has sadly been neglected in the last couple of years but provides a deeper insight).

## My job-to-be-done and how I know I’m successful

* My colleagues can rely on my work, and on the things I say
* I make people feel welcome and create environments where people want to collaborate with me
* Everyone feels good asking questions around my work or any related topic I can help out with
* I can detach from my work when needed and take on a different perspective 
* I follow accessibility guidelines in my work
* I get things done and move things forward

## What I value

I value working with people, solving problems — **together** — to empower others in their work. I want my work to be meaningful and have a positive impact on the people around me.  

I have been working remotely for over a decade now so keeping communication and decision-making process open and accessible is important to me. If I can't be in the room where it happens (Hamilton reference, sorry not sorry), I want to make sure I am not left out of the discussion.

I can't get behind things I don't believe in — so I am quite picky about companies I want to work with.

## Who I am

I often say that I have been in this industry for a long time, and that is mostly to put the emphasis on how this time has affected me and helped me grow as the person I am today, both professionally and personally. I think the historic context is often important to understand why things are done the way they are and that is often the first step when improving on things and processes.

Web standards movement in the 2000's and responsive web design in the 2010's marked my career considerably, with great emphasis on usability and accessibility. I educate myself constantly on these topics and I care deeply about building things that are accessible, and this is the field that I see as crucial in the everyday design of things. 

I have also held workshops and talks to share what I have learned and to help others as others have helped me in the past. Availability of online learning resources over the years has literally changed my life and I want to make sure I pay it forward. Bottom line, I want to be there for others, so that we can build something together we can be proud of. 

### Features / strengths

* **Multi-disciplinary.** In my career I have worked in many different areas of design and also for a long time at the intersection of design and development as a front-end designer. This has given me a good understanding on the challenges when implementing complex design solutions into code.

* **Working transparently.** I think collaboration is critical skill in the modern and remote workplace and the only way we can get better at it is to be more transparent in our work. I always appreciated working in the open, and I try to document my work as much as possible and work where other people can access it easily, get informed, act or learn from it.

* **Learning new things.** I am not afraid to tackle new things. At first I might feel uneasy about being faced with a challenge, even feel like I'm in over my head, but in the end I appreciate the experience I get from work. 

* **Practicing empathy.** I consider myself to be a highly empathetic individual. I will share my feelings in a safe environment and take things to heart when others are concerned. This also means I will often take the side of the end-user, and try to put myself in their shoes.

### In development / growth areas

* **Being a better communicator.** This is something I am trying to improve constantly. Being a non-native English speaker, things don't always come easy, and it probably shows. I have taken on public speaking (pre-pandemic) as one of my goals to work towards becoming a better presenter, storyteller, mentor and a leader. I strive to become better at this and see communication as the skill I will want perfect constantly.

* **Being a domain expert.** I value systematic thinking, but it comes with a challenge when you are working in a completely new landscape. It might take time for me to better understand how my work can and will impact the product, people and company goals. Guidance is always welcome, but I might need time to process everything to feel truly comfortable in the role. 

### Known bugs / things I do that may annoy you

* **Writing too much.** I tend to write things down, a lot. I am also trying to be considerate and summarise things and make sure you are not reading the first draft. Writing things help me better understand the topic and it's the first step in clearing my head and making sense of things.

* **Talking too much.** There are situations when I talk too much. It might be because I am passionate about something, but it might also be just me going off track and diving too much into details. I don't mind you interrupting me to make sure we are on track and cover all important topics — I don't want to monopolise the meeting or the time we have available, it's important for me that everyone has a voice.

### Gaining trust

* **Be honest.** This is something I value deeply and I consider as a base of building long-lasting relationships. We are all human. If you make a mistake, be candid about it, we can work on fixing it together. If you are proud about something, please share it with me so that I can share the excitement and learn from you.

* **Be constructive.** If you are giving feedback, make sure it's constructive. Sometimes things just don't _feel right_ and it's OK to call it out and bring attention to it, but please try to provide a deeper context on _why_ and _potential solutions_ or _paths to explore_ in finding a solution.

## Logistics / communication

* **Written communication.** Slack (among others) these days is the golden standard for ~~instant~~ async communication. I will always try to respond as soon as possible, but I don't check work-related communication outside of working hours (which are sometimes flexible).

* **Video calls.** I like having face time with people. I think this is also a great way to build relationships (in the absence of sharing a cup of coffee or tea in person). 

Overall, when working remotely and asynchronously I rely on both written and video communication to achieve a goal. When I am collaborating with people in multiple time zones, I prefer to discuss things with the combination of both. That's mostly because video calls tend to be draining for me, so if I have several calls in the afternoon, my output in these calls will be limited and I might prefer to answer it via text when I'm energised and after a cup of coffee.

## The pandemic

**Waiting it out and slowly re-building my life.** Even though I went through the pandemic mostly unscathed, it has changed my outlook on certain things and I am really grateful to my partner, family and support from my friends and colleagues. 

I haven't taken new hobbies through the pandemic (I did revitalise my photography passion though) — I am just happy that I *survived*. This has been so emotionally draining, that I feel uneasy even thinking about it. I am very grateful to the people I have worked with for the understanding and support during these ~~months~~ years as ~~I~~ we slowly recover.

## Submit a bug / how I give and receive feedback

I am **open to receiving feedback in all forms**, and preferably early on so that I can act accordingly and fix things before they become a bigger problem. 

I try to give constructive feedback to others, but might lean more to written feedback as it's often easier to organise my thoughts before sharing. I might wait a little before giving feedback to get to know you, and how you work as I want to make sure I understand the broader context before providing feedback.
